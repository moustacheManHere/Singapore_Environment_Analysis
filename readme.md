# Environmental Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Environmental Data Analysis project! In this project, I have utilized a variety of data wrangling, scraping, visualization, and analysis techniques to gain insights from environmental data in Singapore. The primary objective of this project is to showcase my skills in working with real-world datasets and extracting valuable information to make informed decisions regarding environmental performance.

## Data Sources

To carry out this analysis, I have used several data sources, in various formats (csv, excel, json, sql, txt). I have also scraped data from a website.

## Libraries Used

I have employed several Python libraries to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Here are the key libraries used in this project:

- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and data handling.

- **Scikit-learn:** Specifically, the `IterativeImputer` and `IsolationForest` modules for imputation and anomaly detection.

- **Plotly:** Employed for creating interactive data visualizations and plots.

- **Statsmodels:** Used for statistical analysis and modeling.

- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static visualizations and plots.

- **Requests and BeautifulSoup:** Utilized for web scraping to gather additional data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Wrangling and Preprocessing:** In this section, I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. I used Pandas and Scikit-learn for tasks such as data imputation, feature engineering, and handling missing values.

2. **Data Visualization:** I created various data visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib to explore and present insights from the environmental data. These visualizations help in better understanding the data's patterns and trends.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** Using Statsmodels, I performed statistical analyses to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset. This section includes hypothesis testing and regression analysis.

4. **Web Scraping:** To enrich our dataset, I conducted web scraping using Requests and BeautifulSoup to collect additional information related to environmental factors.

## Conclusion

This Environmental Data Analysis project showcases my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. By utilizing real-world environmental data from Singapore, I have demonstrated the ability to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions. This project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in environmental data analysis or looking to learn more about data science techniques applied to real-world datasets.
